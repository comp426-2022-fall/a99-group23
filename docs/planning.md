## Planning / Execution Process
We had two meetings - one for initial planning and one for syncing our code.

### 11/30/22
This brief meeting was dedicated to understanding the project's requirements,
brainstorming ideas for our application, and designating roles to team members.

We did some individual work between the two meetings, but most was done together.

### 12/03/22
In this meeting, we worked together to sync frontend, backend, and database - the
majority of the application's functionality was implemented during this meeting. First,
we re-iterated our plans, and then proceeded to implement. We began with making a basic
working skeleton for a web application. Next, a large chunk of time was devoted to creating
the functionality of our login page. Lastly, we built out the rest of the application's
features such as the checklist.
