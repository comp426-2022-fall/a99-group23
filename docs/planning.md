## Planning / Execution Process
We had two meetings - one for initial planning and one for syncing our code.

### 11/30/22
This meeting was dedicated to understanding the project's requirements,
brainstorming ideas for our application, and designating roles to team members.

Members did some individual work between the two meetings, but most was done together.

### 12/03/22
In this meeting, members worked together to sync frontend, backend, and database - the
majority of the application's functionality was implemented during this meeting.
