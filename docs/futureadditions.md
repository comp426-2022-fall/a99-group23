## Future Additions
At the moment, our application allows a user to select a common pantry item that they may have and want to use, and then presents them with a single recipe for inspiration. In the future, it would make sense for the application to:
* Allow the user to select multiple pantry items at the same time
* Generate multiple recipes for the user to select from
* Save recipes the user may want to use later
* Include more ingredients and recipes, overall
